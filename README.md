A light, simple, fast periodic table app built with SwiftUI, and also uses Apple Foundation Models

- Added SF Symbols and animations to make it a pleasure to use
- Sort items in list view or filter by category, phase, group, period, or block
- See lots of information about each element when you tap on one in the table view
- Detailed onboarding that you can come back to in settings

# Try It Out

1. Clone with `https://github.com/omeriadon/Elements.git`
2. Build and run with Xcode, preferably onto a real device

It's optimised for iPhone, so it's best to run the app there.
